# Readest × Kavita V1 Status

This document is the execution log for the Kavita V1 integration. It records
hard gates, reproducible checks, and known blockers. Secrets and local Kavita
test infrastructure must never be added to this repository.

## Locked baseline

- Readest: `v0.12.1` / `f3e1df7e0572c0119cbb420e1e27ca9af859f91c`
- foliate-js: `f65836f77e8b66b84baacd54bfc92096578e7a84`
- Kavita minimum: `v0.9.0.2`
- Feature branch: `feat/kavita-v1`
- Integration worktree: `readest-bootstrap-kavita-v1`
- Original `main` worktree remained clean throughout bootstrap.

## Phase status

| Phase | Status | Gate evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0 — isolated baseline | Complete | Exact SHAs verified; submodules synchronized; `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` passed |
| Phase 1 — API and range proof | Pending | Must pass real Kavita `206` and authenticated EPUB open without a full-file response |
| Phase 2 — connection and shelf sync | Pending | Library selection, staged pagination, and deletion safety |
| Phase 3 — reading, cache, offline | Pending | foliate-js lazy read, persistent LRU cache, verified offline transfer |
| Phase 4 — progress and credentials | Pending | Kavita-owned progress, encrypted credentials, conflict handling |
| Phase 5 — platform acceptance | Pending | Web, Windows, and Android runtime gates |

## Phase 0 verification

Run from the integration worktree root:

```text
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --filter @readest/readest-app setup-vendors
pnpm lint
pnpm test -- --run
```

Results on 2026-08-19:

- lint: passed (`1992` files checked)
- unit tests: `706` files passed, `4` skipped
- assertions: `8952` passed, `16` skipped
- Android prerequisites installed: Android SDK 36, Build Tools 36.0.0,
  platform-tools 37.0.1, emulator 37.1.11, NDK 28.2.13676358, and the
  Android 36 Google APIs x86_64 system image

## Current blockers

- None for implementation.
- Web support remains conditional on Kavita CORS, HTTPS/mixed-content rules,
  certificate trust, and exposed Range headers.
